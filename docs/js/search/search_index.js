This gives the library time to wait for a more complete sequence, otherwise the single sequence will be triggered.\nfor example: binding both \"? a\" and \"?\", then clicking \"?\" will trigger the \"?\" callback, but only after 500ms delay.\nHowever, in all other cases there's no delay in execution of the callback (unless debounceTime is provided)\nExamples:\nThis library supports gmail style sequences:\n   [{\n        key: [\"g a\"],\n        command: (output: ShortcutEventOutput) => console.log(\"? a\", output),\n    }]konami code:\n    [{\n         key: [\"up up down down left right left right b a enter\"],\n         label: \"Sequences\",\n         description: \"Konami code!\",\n         command: (output: ShortcutEventOutput) => console.log(\"Konami code!!!\", output),\n    }]Sequences can be used inside components or directives and are declared without the plus(+) sign, for example:\nkey: [\"a b c\"]\nwill require clicking, a, then b, then c.\nComponents:\nng-keyboard-shortcuts\nComponent that can be used across the app to bind to various shortcuts  \nInputs:\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDefault\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nshortcuts\nShortcutInput / ShortcutInput[]\n[]\nList of shortcut inputs types see types\n\n\ndisabled\nboolean\nfalse\ndisable the shortcuts for the component\n\n\n\nMethods:\n\n\n\nName\nInput\nReturn\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nselect\nstring - key to listen to events (example: 'cmd + e')\nObservable\nListen to specific key events (will only work for registered keys)\n\n\n\n  \nimport { AfterViewInit, Component, ElementRef, OnInit, ViewChild } from \"@angular/core\";
