that provides a declarative API using components/directive to manage Keyboard shortcuts in scalable way.  \nThis documentation is for version 7.0.0+ (8,9) and any future versions.For older versions (2.0.0/6.0.0) please click here  \nSee demo here:demo  \nimportant note\nWe recommend to update to version 7.0.0 and above and use the new component API which has a better memory management than previous version.  \nCompatible with Angular 5+  \n\nInstall  \nSetup  \nDemo\nUsage  \nCombinations\nSequences\nComponents  \nKeyboardshortcuts  \nHelpScreen\n\n\nDirective

BrowserModule,  \n        KeyboardShortcutsModule.forRoot()  \n    ],  \n    bootstrap: [AppComponent]  \n})  \nexport class AppModule {  \n}  Usage:\nCombinations\nkey combinations are used with meta keys like control, shift, command, etc... and are defined using plus(+) sign as a separator.\nthere can be multiple combinations for the same command, so either of the key combination will trigger the callback.\nSince combinations uses the plus sign as a seperator, if you want to bind to the actual + charachater,\nyou will need to use \"plus\" instead.\nExamples:\n   [\n       {\n            key: [\"cmd + a\"],\n            command: (output: ShortcutEventOutput) => console.log(\"command + a\", output),\n        },\n        {\n            key: \"ctrl + a\",\n            preventDefault: true,\n            command: (output: ShortcutEventOutput) => console.log(\"control + a\", output),\n            \n        },\n        {\n            key: \"ctrl + plus\",\n            preventDefault: true,\n            command: (output: ShortcutEventOutput) => console.log(\"control + plus key\", output),\n        }\n    ]Sequences\nSequences can be used to support gmail like actions where you click \"g\" then \"a\", or \"g\" then \"o\" to perform certain actions.\nImportant note\nThe library can get very confused if you have a single key handler that uses the same key that a sequence starts with. \nThis is because it can't tell if you are starting the sequence or if you are pressing that key on its own.\nTo counter this, there is a 500ms delay(only when single key is used in the beginning of another sequence, so it won't affect performance)\n. This gives the library time to wait for a more complete sequence, otherwise the single sequence will be triggered.\nfor example: binding both \"? a\" and \"?\", then clicking \"?\" will trigger the \"?\" callback, but only after 500ms delay.\nHowever, in all other cases there's no delay in execution of the callback (unless debounceTime is provided)\nExamples:\nThis library supports gmail style sequences:\n   [{\n        key: [\"g a\"],\n        command: (output: ShortcutEventOutput) => console.log(\"? a\", output),\n    }]konami code:\n    [{\n         key: [\"up up down down left right left right b a enter\"],\n         label: \"Sequences\",\n         description: \"Konami code!\",\n         command: (output: ShortcutEventOutput) => console.log(\"Konami code!!!\", output),\n    }]Sequences can be used inside components or directives and are declared without the plus(+) sign, for example:\nkey: [\"a b c\"]\nwill require clicking, a, then b, then c.\nComponents:\nng-keyboard-shortcuts\nComponent that can be used across the app to bind to various shortcuts  \nInputs:\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDefault\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nshortcuts\nShortcutInput / ShortcutInput[]\n[]\nList of shortcut inputs types see types\n\n\ndisabled\nboolean\nfalse\ndisable the shortcuts for the component\n\n\n\nMethods:\n\n\n\nName\nInput\nReturn\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nselect\nstring - key to listen to events (example: 'cmd + e')\nObservable\nListen to specific key events (will only work for registered keys)\n\n\n\n  \nimport { AfterViewInit, Component, ElementRef, OnInit, ViewChild } from \"@angular/core\";
