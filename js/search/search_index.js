components/directive to manage Keyboard shortcuts in scalable way.  \nThis documentation is for version ^7.0.0.  For older versions (2.0.0/6.0.0) please click here  \nSee demo here:demo  \nimportant note\nWe recommend to update to version 7.0.0 and use the new component API which has a better memory management than previous version.  \nCompatible with Angular 5+  \n\nInstall  \nSetup  \nUsage  \nCombinations\nSequences\nComponents  \nKeyboardshortcuts  \nHelpScreen  \n\n\nDirective  \nngKeyboardShortcut  \n\n\nService  \nKeyboardShortcutsHelpService  \n\n\n\n\nAPI  \nTypes  \nAllowIn  \nShortcut  \nShortcutInput  \nShortcutEventOutput  \n\n\n\n\nBuilding  \nPublishing  \nLicense  \n\nInstall:\nnpm install --save ng-keyboard-shortcuts  \nor yarn\nyarn add ng-keyboard-shortcuts  \nSetup:\n```typescriptimport { KeyboardShortcutsModule }     from 'ng-keyboard-shortcuts';  \n@NgModule({    declarations: [  \n    ],    imports: [        BrowserModule,        KeyboardShortcutsModule.forRoot()    ],    bootstrap: [AppComponent]})export class AppModule {}  \n```  \nUsage:\nCombinations\nkey combinations are used with meta keys like control, shift, command, etc... and are defined using plus(+) sign as a separator.\nthere can be multiple combinations for the same command, so either of the key combination will trigger the callback.\nExamples:\n```typescript\n   [\n       {\n            key: [\"cmd + a\"],\n            command: (output: ShortcutEventOutput) => console.log(\"command + a\", output),\n        },\n        {\n            key: \"ctrl + a\",\n            preventDefault: true,\n            command: (output: ShortcutEventOutput) => console.log(\"control + a\", output),\n    }\n]```\nSequences\nSequences can be used to support gmail like actions where you click \"g\" then \"a\", or \"g\" then \"o\" to perform certain actions.\nImportant note\nThe library can get very confused if you have a single key handler that uses the same key that a sequence starts with. \nThis is because it can't tell if you are starting the sequence or if you are pressing that key on its own.\nTo counter this, there is a 500ms delay(only when single key is used in the beginning of another sequence, so it won't affect performance)\n. This gives the library time to wait for a more complete sequence, otherwise the single sequence will be triggered.\nfor example: binding both \"? a\" and \"?\", then clicking \"?\" will trigger the \"?\" callback, but only after 500ms delay.\nHowever, in all other cases there's no delay in execution of the callback (unless debounceTime is provided)\nExamples:\nThis library supports gmail style sequences:\ntypescript\n   [{\n        key: [\"g a\"],\n        command: (output: ShortcutEventOutput) => console.log(\"? a\", output),\n    }]\nkonami code:\ntypescript\n    [{\n         key: [\"up up down down left right left right b a enter\"],\n         label: \"Sequences\",\n         description: \"Konami code!\",\n         command: (output: ShortcutEventOutput) => console.log(\"Konami code!!!\", output),\n    }]\nSequences can be used inside components or directives and are declared without the plus(+) sign, for example:\nkey: [\"a b c\"]\nwill require clicking, a, then b, then c.\nComponents:\nng-keyboard-shortcuts\nComponent that can be used across the app to bind to various shortcuts  \nInputs:\n| Name   |      Type      |  Default         | Description ||----------|:-------------:|-----------------:  |:-------------:|| shortcuts |  ShortcutInput / ShortcutInput[] | [] | List of shortcut inputs types see types || disabled |    boolean  |   false   | disable the shortcuts for the component |  \nMethods:\n| Name  | Input | Return  | Description ||----------|:------|:------:|:-------------:|| select | string - key to listen to events (example: 'cmd + e') | Observable |Listen to specific key events (will only work for registered keys) |  \n```typescript  \nimport { AfterViewInit, Component, ElementRef, OnInit, ViewChild } from \"@angular/core\";import { ShortcutInput, ShortcutEventOutput, KeyboardShortcutsComponent } from \"ng-keyboard-shortcuts\";  \n@Component({    selector: 'demo-component',    template: \"\"  \n})export class DemoComponent implements AfterViewInit {  \nshortcuts: ShortcutInput[] = [];  \n@ViewChild('input') input: ElementRef;  \n\nngAfterViewInit(): void {  \n    this.shortcuts.push(  \n        {  \n            key: \"ctrl + t\",  \n            preventDefault: true,  \n            allowIn: [AllowIn.Textarea, AllowIn.Input],  \n            command: e => console.log(\"clicked \" , e.key)  \n        },\n       {\n            key: [\"?
